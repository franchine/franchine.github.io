# Deployed React Application

This branch (`gh-pages`) contains the production-ready build of the React application hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

This branch serves the static files generated by the React build process (`npm run build`). GitHub Pages is configured to serve the `index.html` file located at the root of this branch, which then loads the rest of the application's assets.

## Deployment

The content of this branch is typically generated and updated through an automated deployment process, often using the `gh-pages` npm package.

**To update this deployed version:**

1.  Ensure you have built the latest version of the React application from the main development branch using `npm run build`. This will create a `build` folder in the project's root.
2.  Run the deployment command (usually defined in the `scripts` section of `package.json`, e.g., `npm run deploy`). This command typically handles:
    * Building the application.
    * Copying the contents of the `build` folder to this `gh-pages` branch.
    * Pushing the changes to this branch on the remote repository.

## Important Notes

* **Do not manually edit files in this branch directly unless you understand the implications.** Changes here will directly affect the live website. It's generally better to make changes in the main development branch and then redeploy.
* This branch should primarily contain the static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) generated by the build process.

For the source code and development history of this application, please refer to the main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
